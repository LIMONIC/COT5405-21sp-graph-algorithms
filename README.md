## Introduction

In this project, several graph algorithms was implemented to construct optimal graphs, check connected components, find
cycles and find the shortest path from one node to all other nodes in the graph. The project can be mainly divided into
two parts:

1. In the first part, DFS algorithms are designed for finding connected components and cycles. Dijkstra's algorithm is
   implemented for finding the shortest paths between nodes.
2. In the second part, a collection of general graph functions are created. Those graphs are employed for testing the
   functions in part one.
3. In the third part, billions of movie rating data from Netflix are translated into graphs with different adjacency
   criteria. Methods that implemented in part 1 are used to analyze the graphs and to deliver insightful results.

The performance of the programs are instrumented by run-time and memory consumption.
